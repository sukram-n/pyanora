A piano rehearsal accompanist for practicing a musical instrument.

This is still work in progress. At present

- only exercises targeted towards double bass players are included
- Not all exercises have fingerings yet
- I plan to allow to choose from different fingering sources. At present fingerings from Ludwig Streicher (L. Streicher, "Tonleitern f√ºr Kontrabass") are shown.
- I will add other types of accompaniment (e.g. chords)
